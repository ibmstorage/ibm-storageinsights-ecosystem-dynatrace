# 1. Introduction

[IBM Storage Insights](https://www.ibm.com/products/storage-insights) is a cloud based service that allows you to analyze, protect and optimize your storage infrastructure. It provides a single pane monitoring across your storage, fabric, and hosts. Gain insights into the status, health, capacity, and performance of the storage devices in your environment. Use this information to identify and troubleshoot problems, plan for your capacity needs, and identify performance bottlenecks.

Dynatrace is an open and extensible platform. You can extend the observability data collected out of the box with data provided by observability standards and frameworks such as OpenTelemetry and Prometheus. Dynatrace can ingest data from a wide range of tools available in the Dynatrace Hub, enabling continuous, actionable data flows that help quickly resolve issues, maintain complex systems, enhance code quality, and accelerate digital transformation. It acts as a single source of truth for observability.

The IBM Storage Insights Dynatrace Extension 2.0 enables customers to seamlessly monitor the health, capacity, and performance of their storage systems within IBM Storage Insights, utilizing Dynatrace dashboards for comprehensive visibility.

## 2. Dynatrace Extensions 2.0 Python SDK

      ```bash
      cd ibm-storageinsights-ecosystem-dynatrace/
      ```
  3. Create a new build by running the below command.
      ```bash
      dt-sdk build --extra-platform None
      ```
  4. The `dt-sdk` command needs to be executed on the machine where the github repo mentioned in step 5.2.1 is cloned.

## 6. Support for Issues and Improvement Requests
As an open-source project, the IBM Storage Insights Dynatrace integration follows a community-supported model, so IBM does not provide formal support for this dashboard. Designed as a do-it-yourself solution, it allows users to customize and troubleshoot independently. However, if you encounter issues or have ideas for improvements, you can connect with the project’s contributors and submit your requests via the project’s GitHub page.
